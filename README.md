# Rename-Image-Files
A short code written in Java used to rename all of the images in a directory.

The program works with only one type of files (.jpg) and renames them in an incrementing order, starting from 01, 02 etc.

For those that would want to use this for their purposes, here are the necessary changes: on line 24 and 35 change "SK" to your PC name and change "ChangeName" to the name of the folder which contains images that need to be renamed.
